# Bootstrapping Machine Learning with Pre-Trained Models

This repository contains a notebook-based introduction to quick ML prototyping
using the [Hugging Face `transformers`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
library and [Gradio](https://gradio.app/). It will be given to attendees of my
talk at [Uncommon Hacks 2022] as a "parting gift."
